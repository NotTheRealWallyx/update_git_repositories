# Update git repositories

This repository helps you having all the repositories updated with git. It search all the folder that have `.git` folder and updates the repository. The folder that are being checked are the ones on the user folder. Repositories outside the user one will not be updated. Works on Linux and MacOs systems, need to try it on Windows.

## How to install

Follow this two steps to install the command:

Clone the repository
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/sWallyx/update_git_repositories.git
```

Run the install script*
``` bash
./install.sh
```

Done! You will have the command available** on the terminal.

_* On some cases you may need to make it executable first `chmod +x install.sh`_

_** You might need to restart the terminal_

## Usage

After making the installation write on the terminal `git-update` and you will see how all the repositories update.

Have fun coding.
